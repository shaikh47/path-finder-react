1. Choose a starting vertex as the current vertex and mark it as visited.
2. Push the current vertex onto a stack data structure.
3. While the stack is not empty, do the following steps:
    - Pop a vertex from the stack and set it as the current vertex.
    - Process the current vertex (e.g., print it or perform any desired operations).
    - Explore all adjacent unvisited vertices of the current vertex.
    - For each unvisited adjacent vertex, mark it as visited, push it onto the stack, and break the loop.
4. If there are no unvisited adjacent vertices from the current vertex, backtrack by popping the previous vertex from the stack.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the stack becomes empty.
